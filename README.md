# Mobile voice recorder

## Setup

This project is built on react-native

I have used ignite boilerplate. It comes configured with i18n, storybook(Although I haven't used it as the application is not complex and I am not workingin a team). It also comes configured with state management library MST.

## Theme

As everywhere I have seen Laxis, it has light color theme. So I have decided to go head and use dark theme.
